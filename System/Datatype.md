# This is about the data types in python so lets learn
 - Key Takeaway is range and there is a type range like list, tuple it is sequence type and its range(start,stop,step).
 - Python numbers are just 3 int,float,complex
 - Coming to the most important data structure String in python no more jumping to anything lets complete this and learn the absolute basics.
## String 
 - Either Single or double quotation mark is accepted in python as a string. Multiline string is done by """Yeah 3 single or double quotes and as same as for comments."""
 - in and not in return boolean so it can be used for conditional checking and Strings are arrays represented as "Hello" \[H,e,l,l,o] as 0-H,1-2 etc...
### Slicing String
 - Given String can be splitted into the way that I want to split, \[2:5] 2 included but not 5 instead preof 5 ie 4.
 - Only way to combine a string and a int is using fstring and its placed like f"Hello am {age} years old".
 - {} within this you could further do changes using : eg: {price:.2f} & math operations etc...
 - isinstance(x, int) is something that can be used to check data type.
 - Membership and identity operators exist in python.
## Store Collections of data
 - List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary
 - List as [], Ordered, Changable and allows duplicate values.
