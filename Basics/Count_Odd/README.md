# This is the 1/150 within the roadmap in leetcode

- Why?
    - Solving Problem to improve my coding and math skills
- How? 
    - Used Basic Approach of O(n) and a for loop so its O(n)
- What is the problem?
    - Within a given range find all Odd Numbers
- When?
    - Use AP(Arithmetic Progression), so low is altered to low+1(odd number) and also high to high-1(odd number) and ((high-low)/2)+1.
    - take case of low=2, high=8, now high is 7 and low is 3 and ((7-3)/2)+1 ie: 2+1=3 \[3,5,7].
