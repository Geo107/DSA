# This is my very first CodeForce problem that I did so from now on I ensure that I do everyday some problems and doesn't lack consistency so let' go

- What is the Problem?
    - Split the Watermelons in even numbers so one case is if watermelon length is 2 and to splitting it creates two ODD NUMBER (1 \& 1);
- Why this Problem?
    - I was able to know how to submit in Codeforce and also that "using namespace std" still doesn't work in GNU C11 and also allowed me to understand brute force and math.    
- How this Helps?
    - This helps me to brute force and understand and how edge case must be done.
- When u use this approach?
    - Basically every problem.
- Time Complexity = O(1);
